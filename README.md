# Tsunami Evacuation Simulation: Vertical Evacuation Structure (VES) Impact Analysis
## Overview
This interactive simulation demonstrates the critical importance of Vertical Evacuation Structures (VES) in coastal communities facing tsunami threats. This educational tool compares evacuation outcomes with and without VES infrastructure.

## Purpose
The simulation aims to:

- Educate community members about tsunami evacuation challenges
- Demonstrate the life-saving impact of VES
- Visualize evacuation dynamics under time-constrained scenarios
- Support planning decisions for coastal emergency infrastructure

## Simulation Features
Two-Scenario Comparison

- Without VES: Residents must evacuate to distant high ground
- With VES: Residents can reach nearby VES structures or high ground

## Key Parameters

- Population: 100 residents scattered across the hazard zone
= Evacuation Window: 15-20 minutes (adjustable: 10-30 minutes)
- Walking Speed: Adjustable from 0.5 m/s to 3.0 m/s to simulate different mobility levels


## Interactive Controls

- Start/Reset Buttons: Control simulation playback
- Tsunami Arrival Time Slider: Adjust warning time (10-30 minutes)
- Walking Speed Slider: Simulate different population mobility (0.5-3.0 m/s)

## Visual Elements
Zones

* Hazard Zone (red-brown): Area at risk from tsunami inundation
* Safe Zone (green): High ground above tsunami reach
* VES Structures: Two multi-story evacuation buildings in the hazard zone

## Population Indicators

* 🔵 Blue dots: Residents actively evacuating
* 🟢 Green dots: Successfully evacuated to safety
* 🔴 Red dots: Unable to reach safety before tsunami arrival
* 🌊 Blue wave: Advancing tsunami front

## Educational Insights
Why VES Matters

- Accessibility: VES structures provide nearby safe refuge for residents far from high ground
- Mobility: Critical for elderly, disabled, or mobility-impaired individuals
